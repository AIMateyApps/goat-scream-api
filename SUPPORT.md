# Support

We want Goat Screams API to stay both fun and reliable. Use the channels below so issues land with the right humans.

## When to open a GitHub Issue

- Bug reports reproducible on `main`
- Documentation fixes
- Requests for new endpoints or data fields
- Build / tooling problems

Use the issue templates if available. Include logs, curl repro steps, and your OS + Node versions.

## When to start a Discussion

- Ideas, teaching stories, or demo showcases
- “How do I…?” questions about extending the API
- Requests for collaboration or pairing sessions

## Security incidents

Email `security@goatscreams.com` instead of opening an issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

## Response times

- Weekdays: expect a first response within 48 hours
- Weekends / holidays: best effort (this is a side project!)

If you need a faster turn-around for a talk or live stream, mention the date in your issue and we’ll do our best to help.
